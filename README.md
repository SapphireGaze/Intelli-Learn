## I. Introduction üëÄ

<div align="justify">
IntelliLearn is a project submitted to the Google AI Hackathon, aimed at building a creative app that utilizes Google‚Äôs Generative AI tools to enhance the learning experience for students!
</div>

## II. Features üìö

* Multimodal ML model Personalized with OCR with adaptive handwriting recognition
* Custom user data analysis for track your learning progression
* Intelligent flashcard generator based on LaTeX document
* Summarize and listen your notes instantly
* Collaboration mode and easy export and sharing

## III. Inspiration ‚ú®

<div align="justify">
The initial spark for IntelliLearn came from observing the struggles that students and educators faced during the COVID-19 pandemic with the transition to remote learning. Many students found it difficult to share and access high-quality notes in a uniform, readable format. Our aim was to create a solution that not only made it easier to digitize handwritten notes but also enhanced the learning experience through advanced technology.

## IV. What it does üî•

<div align="justify">
IntelliLearn transforms handwritten notes into highly organized, digital formats. Using state-of-the-art AI, specifically the Gemini Pro Vision model, it recognizes and learns from individual handwriting styles for more accurate text conversion. Once the notes are digitized, the application automatically converts them into formatted LaTeX documents, creates interactive flashcards, and generates audio summaries for auditory learning. It also includes features for organizing notes and sharing them as LaTeX files!

## V. How we built it üõ†Ô∏è

<div align="justify">
We built IntelliLearn by integrating various technologies. The handwriting recognition was developed using Gemini API on a diverse dataset of handwritten notes. For the LaTeX conversion, we utilized existing LaTeX compilers adapted to our specific requirements. The frontend was designed with a user-friendly interface in React Native, while the backend logic was handled by Golang and MySQL for user authentication, information processing, and database management.

## VI. Challenges we ran into üí•

<div align="justify">
One of the significant challenges was improving the accuracy of the handwriting recognition algorithm to handle diverse handwriting styles. Another challenge was ensuring the seamless integration of the LaTeX conversion, which required extensive testing and tweaking to handle various formatting challenges. Scalability and user data security were also key concerns that we addressed meticulously.

## VII. Accomplishments that we're proud of üéâ

<div align="justify">
We are particularly proud of the robustness of our handwriting recognition technology, which has shown high accuracy levels across various user tests. The seamless conversion of handwritten notes to formatted LaTeX documents and the positive feedback from initial user trials also stand out as major accomplishments. Additionally, creating an intuitive user interface that simplifies the learning process was a significant achievement.

## VIII. What we learned üß†

<div align="justify">
Throughout the development process, we learned a great deal about the complexities of machine learning in practical applications, especially in processing and interpreting handwritten text. We also gained insights into user experience design, ensuring that the app not only performs well but is also accessible and easy to use. The importance of data security and ethical considerations in AI were also crucial learning points.

## IX. What's next for IntelliLearn ‚è≠Ô∏è

<div align="justify">
Looking ahead, we plan to expand IntelliLearn's capabilities by incorporating multilingual support to cater to a global user base. We also aim to enhance our AI model for even better accuracy and adaptability. Further integration with educational platforms and LMS tools is on the roadmap to make IntelliLearn a staple tool in educational environments. Additionally, exploring potential uses in professional settings for meeting notes and collaborative projects is also planned.
